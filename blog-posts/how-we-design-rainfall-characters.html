					<strong>How We Design Rainfall Characters<br/></strong>
				</h2>
				<p>
				When designing characters for Rainfall, we’ve taken an unique approach to constructing the character through a process we call a Let’s Draw. As the name implies, our methodology is a communal drawing session for a character where both of us start on the same blank canvas and draw the character together, almost like the artistic version of pair-programming. We believe that this method of creating characters allow for us to accomplish several key objectives: iterate quickly on different designs, reduce the period of back and forths on design and personality traits of a character, and create stronger and more cohesive designs through incorporating our different views on the same character.
				</p>
				<p>
				The characters of our game tend to come from two origins either to satisfy a story requirement or to create a certain archetype. In the first scenario, we start with their personality and how they interact with other characters this is how a character like Yumeko and Akane were created. Both of them were designed around being foils to other characters, Mari and Jin respectively. Their place in the overall story was cemented first and then we developed a look based off of that personality. For the second scenario, the prototype of this method was Mari who was designed around the Chuuni personality and wanting to create our own version of a Megumin-esque character from Konosuba.
				</p>
				<p>
				Regardless of their origins though, the overall process follows the same methodology starting first with...
				</p>
				<h2>
					<strong>Pre-Production<br/></strong>
				</h2>
				<p>
				In the pre-production step, we come up with a list of images that inspire us in some way for this character in terms of personality and look. For the purposes of this article we’ll be looking at the character of Emi, a socially recluse and famous game developer who created the Death Crown series of games. The pitch for her character was the “distorted embodiment of a 4chan shitposter” with her speech full of weird and obscure references to anime and games, a disdain for people, but having a very analytical and thoughtful mind when it comes to discussing anime and games. It’s with these very basic traits we created our image map of inspirations looking like this:

				<h2>
					<strong>Let’s Draw<br/></strong>
				</h2>
				<p>
				The Let’s Draw session begins with one person in control of drawing and streaming their progress to the other person. We start with discussing the image references while working on the initial construction of the character’s body. The focus here is not on producing a final image but creating a rough black and white sketch where we try to capture the feeling of a character. We start with the posing of the character as our first decision. Each of our character’s visual novel styled busts are designed with a different pose in mind both to differentiate each character from each other and to heighten certain aspects of their archetype and/or personality. For Emi, we wanted to give her a pose that highlighted the NEET, awkward nerdy angle. We went with a slight hunch and a defensive type pose that tried to reflect her personality via body language. This pose stuck around for the entirety of her development. From there we focused on the face, and with the Emma Stone and Maho from Stein’s;Gate Zero reference image in mind we gave her hair that would be messy and unkempt while still being visually pleasing. We really liked the concept that while in her work life she is very dedicated and puts all of her effort into it, because of that though she tends to neglect anything else. One example of this is her hair which is supposed to represent a dye job she gave herself but never kept up with so her roots have grown out.
				</p>
				<img src="../images/blog-posts/how-we-design-rainfall-characters/rough drafts.png" alt="Rough Drafts" />
				<p>
				After producing the initial rough sketch, we experiment with colorings and try several variations on the same character design. Some changes may be small like trying out a few dozen glasses shapes while others can be more drastic like changing of the posing, different hair styles, and outfits. If the character doesn’t stick with us during these rough sketches then the character isn’t good enough to make it to an actual bust and must be iterated on again. While it is true that the character could be considered adequate once we get the final lines in and clean up their outfits, that just means the final product is not hitting the peak for that character and will be forgotten by the player. We want each of our designs to be memorable to the player even if they forget all of the dialogue of the game. The designs themselves should make a player want to talk to this character more and anticipate their scenes. If we don’t feel that in the rough draft, then why bother with that character design.
				</p>
				<h2>
					<strong>Initial Implementation<br/></strong>
				</h2>
				<img src="../images/blog-posts/how-we-design-rainfall-characters/initial implementation.png" alt="Initial Implementation" />
				<p>
				After creating the rough sketch with some colors implemented, we immediately add the bust to the game to test out how the new character looks in different environments and with different characters. We then do rough draft refactors based off of this. For example, we decided to switch the dye job on Emi from white to pink so that she didn’t overlap with Mari’s profile as much. But we reincorporated the black and white into the design on the shirt to tie her design back to Jin’s.
				</p>
				<h2>
					<strong>Initial Bust and Refactor<br/></strong>
				</h2>
				<p>
				Once we are satisfied with the rough draft within the game, we then do a final pass of the bust using the rough draft line work as reference.
				</p>	
				<img src="../images/blog-posts/how-we-design-rainfall-characters/initial busts.png" alt="Initial Busts" />			
				<p>
				Pictured above are the first three versions of Emi’s final design. The image on the left was the very first attempt at a final pass taking a very literal approach to her rough draft sketch. Certain elements may look appealing on the rough draft but don’t always transition over to the final design. For example, the posing, spats, and the colors themselves were changes over the course of production to better capture Emi’s feel. The spats left the leggings exposed too much leaving her with a boring lower half. The arms positioning and the way the cloth laid on the forearms took away from the pajama-like clothes we wanted her to have. The goal was for her outfit to appear to be comfy and baggy likely stretched out due to repeated wear and unwillingness to buy new clothes. In the third image you can see these changes come to fruition with her lower half having huge changes to give her a slightly more punk appearance and lessening the pajama design while retaining the comfiness.
				</p>
				<p>
				Still not fully satisfied though we attempted a few more variations.
				</p>
				<img src="../images/blog-posts/how-we-design-rainfall-characters/final busts.png" alt="Final Busts" />	
				<p>
				Here we remade the glasses and gave her eyebags to transition more towards the workaholic game developer she is and lessen the punk rock persona. We also experimented briefly with giving her baggy, cloth pajama bottoms which while fit her archetype more was decidedly less visually appealing than the shorts and ripped leggings. The leggings provided better “banding” where we had horizontal black areas throughout her body now: leggings, shorts, arms, collar, glasses, hair. This was a more cohesive design and was what we settled on as her final look.
				</p>
				<h2>
					<strong>Initial Bust and Refactor<br/></strong>
				</h2>
				<p>
				With the bust complete we reimplement the character into the game and test out some example scenes, dialogue, and make sure her character fits in with the other characters.
				</p>	
				<img src="../images/blog-posts/how-we-design-rainfall-characters/final implementation.png" alt="Final Implementation" />			
				<p>
				Once fully satisfied we start work on producing that character’s RPG sprite in the game using the Visual Novel Bust as the base thus completing our new character.
